Nmap-Exploit Script Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the nmap-exploit.sh script on Kali Linux or Kali NetHunter. This script automates Nmap scanning, identifies open ports, checks for vulnerabilities, and reports the findings directly to Discord via a webhook.

Step-by-Step Instructions

Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, ensure you have Nmap and jq installed:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap jq -y

Step 2: Create the Script File

Open a terminal and create the script file:

nano nmap-exploit.sh

Copy and paste the script code provided into this file. Remember to replace the placeholder WEBHOOK variable with your Discord webhook URL.

Step 3: Save and Exit

Press CTRL + O to save, then ENTER, and CTRL + X to exit.

Step 4: Make the Script Executable

Run the following command:

chmod +x nmap-exploit.sh

Step 5: Execute the Script

To run the script, use the following command syntax:

./nmap-exploit.sh [Nmap Options] [Target IP or Hostname]

For example:

./nmap-exploit.sh -sV -Pn 192.168.1.1

-sV: Detect service/version info.

-Pn: Skip host discovery.


What Does the Script Do?

Performs an advanced Nmap scan on the provided target.

Lists open ports and the detected services.

Identifies known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with the detected services.

Reports findings directly to your specified Discord channel via webhook.


Script Usage Notes

Customize the Nmap flags according to your needs (e.g., -A, -O).

Ensure your Discord webhook URL is correct in the script (WEBHOOK variable).

The script requires internet connectivity to send data to Discord.
