Nmap Script/Automation


---

Main Script

nmap-alert.sh

Runs a customizable Nmap scan against any host or IP range.

Filters and reports only open TCP ports.

Evaluates the security risk of common ports (SSH, Telnet, FTP, HTTP, SMB, RDP, etc).

Sends the results automatically to your selected Discord channel via webhook (change the WEBHOOK variable in the script).

If no open ports are found, youâ€™ll get a notification saying so.

How to Use

1. Create the script file:

Open a terminal and run:

nano nmap-alert.sh

Copy and paste the code provided in docs/nano_nmap_alert.txt into the nano editor, then save and exit.


2. Edit the WEBHOOK variable in nmap-alert.sh to use your Discord webhook URL.


3. Make the script executable:

chmod +x nmap-alert.sh


4. Run the script with any Nmap options and target:

./nmap-alert.sh [NMAP_OPTIONS] [TARGET]

Example:

./nmap-alert.sh -sV -Pn 192.168.1.1

Example Output

In Discord, you'll receive a message like:

Open ports for -sV -Pn 192.168.1.1:
22/tcp   open  ssh   (Medium - SSH)
80/tcp   open  http  (Medium - HTTP)
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds (High - SMB)

If there are no open ports:

-sV -Pn 192.168.1.100: No open ports found


---

Notes

You can use any valid Nmap parameters (-sV, -Pn, -p-, -A, etc).

Works for any host, device, or IP range you can scan from your machine.

Output is formatted for easy reading and quick risk analysis in Discord.
