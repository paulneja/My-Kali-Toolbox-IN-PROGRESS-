Kali Toolbox (IN PROGRESS)

Welcome to my personal Kali Toolbox!

This repository is a living collection of scripts, small programs, and automation tools that I am building to make cybersecurity, network auditing, and pentesting tasks faster, more efficient, and easier to repeat.
My focus is on creating practical, real-world solutions for everyday problems and challenges encountered when working with Kali Linux and security testing. The project is under constant development and will be updated as I learn new things, experiment with tools, and develop my skills as a hacker and programmer.

What Is Included

Scripts for automating routine security tasks, such as scanning, information gathering, and report generation.

Tools to streamline WiFi auditing, packet injection, handshake capture, and DoS attacks.

Experiments with privilege escalation, exploitation, and custom command-line utilities.

Solutions to common problems in Kali Linux, such as driver installation, kernel issues, and network configuration.

Documentation and comments explaining the logic and usage of each script for easy understanding and customization.

Goals of This Project

To create a personal, ever-growing set of tools for my own ethical hacking practice.

To learn scripting (Bash, Python, etc.) by solving real problems and automating repetitive or complex tasks.

To help others in the community by sharing ready-to-use solutions, step-by-step guides, and real output examples.

To build a habit of documenting and organizing my work so I (and others) can learn from it over time.

To contribute, even in small ways, to open source and the ethical hacking world.

Project Status

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated regularly.
At first, you may find basic or experimental scripts, but over time, more advanced, robust, and polished tools will be added. Check back often for new scripts, updates, and improvements.

How to Use

Each script will include comments and basic documentation inside the file.

Some scripts may require root privileges (sudo) to run, especially for network and WiFi tasks.

You can clone or download this repository and use the scripts as you need, or modify them to fit your workflow.

If you have questions about how a script works, check the comments or open an issue for help.
